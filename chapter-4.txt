[color=#FFCB14]Salt Lick City, so now it should be[/color]
[color=#ffb300]a beautiful night. Celestia's sun is done[/color]
[color=#ffa000]painting the summer sky with breathtaking[/color]
[color=#FF6E30]brushstrokes of flame, and it tucks itself in[/color]

[color=#b40e2f]like all-suffusing amber.[/color][/center][/size][/b][/i][/pre-line]
 
[center][i]Soon, Princess Luna's heavenly lights will return for me to befriend all over again.[/i][/center]
 
"Dreamy?"
 
I turn. "Yeah?"
 
Mom smiles at me. "I just want to remind you to have fun, and come home safe [spoiler]by 1[/spoiler]!"
 
"I will!" 
 
"Can I have a hug before you go?"
 
"Sure!" I trot towards her. As soon as I'm in range, though, Mom yanks me in with her wing and traps me in a tight grip. Showing no mercy, she raises her hoof and delivers a vicious noogie.
 
"Mommmm!" I whine.
 
She giggles. "Sorry, sweetie." She reaches behind me. "Don't forget this!"
 
"I won't!" Grabbing my favorite scarf from her hooves, I take a moment to appreciate its addictively silky texture. I rub the scarf across my hooves and nuzzle it to my cheek.
 
Scarf snugly swaddled around my neck, I soar into the night. With a few flaps of my powerful wings, I break through the clouds.
 
I open my eyes.
 
Heavenly lights surround me.
 
[hr]
 
Owls, though unable to speak, are renowned for their wisdom.
 
Yet even the wisest owl is sometimes brought low by unexpected enemies.
 
[i]Thunk![/i] Hooting and furiously flapping wings yanked Day Dreamer's attention to his window. His eyes widened.

He flopped out of bed, dragging several soft blankets along. After escaping the insidiously comfy pile, the colt scrambled past his nightstand to his white walls' window.

Day Dreamer frantically fumbled with the lock for the better part of twenty seconds, glancing helplessly at his guest outside, until the owl raised a wing. It stared at him and gestured its wing downwards. He nodded.

The colt trotted to his door, then took a deep breath. He swiftly pushed the door open with one hoof and caught it with the other. Its hinges only creaked slightly, so he let out a breath of relief.
 
Carefully, warily, softly, Day Dreamer placed each hoof in front of the other down the stairs, his heart pounding. As he shifted his weight onto the fourth step, it groaned.
 
He winced and froze, his eyes locked on his parents' door.
 
Five silent seconds passed.

Day Dreamer continued downward, deliberately avoiding the fourth step with his other hooves. Finally, he reached the last step. He placed his front right hoof onto the wood floor.
 
“Hoo.”
 
Startled, Day Dreamer nearly slipped. At the last second, he grabbed the railings with both wings and caught himself.
 
He glanced upstairs. Still no noise. He was safe.
 
Something tapped at the window — the owl again. It looked impatient.
 
Day Dreamer shuffled through the kitchen to the back door. He slipped his wing around the knob and painstakingly twisted it counterclockwise until it clicked into place. At his gradual push, the door opened, inviting in a gust of cold air.
 
Wings fluttered. A branch in the backyard bounced, catching Day Dreamer's attention. The owl perched on it pointed its left wing at him, repeatedly curling the tip inward. Nodding, Day Dreamer gently closed the door on his family.
 
The owl launched into the air. Dreamer followed, leaving everything behind.
 
[hr]
 
"Day Dreamer!"
 
I frown. My gut and limbs automatically tense; that's Mom's voice.
 
Now she's right beside me. "Dreamer, [spoiler]why[/spoiler] aren't you home right now?"
 
I start to relax. "Yeah, I know I am." 
 
"It's almost sunrise! You know you should[spoiler]n't[/spoiler] stay up all night."
 
I start to smile. "Yeah, I know I should." 
 
"I'm [spoiler]not[/spoiler] happy with this, Dreamy."
 
I start to tear up. "Yeah, I'm happy too!"

[/size][/b][/i][/pre-line][/center]

[hr]
 
His eyes and mind on the stars above, Day Dreamer almost missed the owl's sudden dive. He faltered, watching the shrinking dark blur for a second. Scrambling to follow, he banked his wings for a tight turn.
 
A few seconds after punching through the oddly thick cloud layer, a tree jumped out at him and he swerved to the left. [i]Trees really shouldn't grow [b]that[/b] tall[/i], he decided as he landed next to the owl. It disappeared in a burst of green flame, leaving behind one highly unamused changeling.
 
Clypeus pointed an accusing hoof. "What gives with the window? You never locked it before!"

 "I'm so sorry! I didn't lock it. My mom did."

"Well, next time make sure to unlock it first."

"She…" Day Dreamer looked down. "My mom said she's going to lock it every night."

 "Well, that's annoying. Why would she do that?"

 "Uh…" 

Icy dread washed over them.
 
"Dreamer." Clypeus stepped over and grabbed the colt by the shoulders. "What happened?"

[hr]
 
[i][b][center][size=0.8em][color=#FFCB14]It was a beautiful day in[/color]
[color=#ffb300]Salt Lick City, so now it should be[/color]
[color=#ffa000]a beautiful night. Celestia's sun is done[/color]

[center][i]Soon, Princess Luna's heavenly lights will return for me to befriend all over again.[/i][/center]
 
"Hey Dreamer!"
 
I turn and beam. "Summer!" 
 
I bound over to Summer Wind and hug him really tight. As he pulls away, I say, "Thanks for coming!" 
 
"Of course! I've never gone night-flying before. I can't wait to try it out."
 
"Trust me, it's super fun! Come with me. Tonight will be a night to remember, I promise."
 
[hr]
 
"You [i]told them?![/i]"
 
Day Dreamer flinched. "I didn't tell them anyone's name! I didn't say anything about [i]you![/i]"
 
"[i]Why did you tell them?![/i]" Clypeus's voice echoed through the clearing.
 
"I thought it was just one pony! I didn't know my parents were listening!"
 
"But [i]why?[/i]"
 
"I didn't mean to! He said he wouldn't tell! I just thought—"
 
"You [i]just thought[/i] what?"
 
"I…" Day Dreamer slumped to the ground. He wrapped his wings around his body. "I… I dunno."

Clypeus gave him a moment to gather his thoughts.

"I just thought that we were so close to being done, and… and he just said he was curious—" The colt winced at his own words.
 
"Go on. What [i]brilliant[/i] argument of his convinced you to tell him everything?"
 
"I didn't tell him everything! I just…" Day Dreamer shut his eyes. "I'd just finished saying changelings are really interesting. He asked if I thought meeting one would be interesting. What was I supposed to say?"
 
"How about 'No'? Or, 'I dunno, that sounds too scary'? Or even, 'AHHH!'" Clypeus sighed. "Nevermind. Go on."
 
The colt swallowed. "Then he said he, uh, he didn't think a colt my age could ever find a changeling on their own, not even somepony as smart as me. He asked how anypony would even… He said he was dying to know how I thought I— how I thought a colt could do it. He started talking about how impressive it would be for anypony my age to…" Day Dreamer saw the changeling's expression and trailed off. "I know I messed up, okay? But I didn't think he'd tell anypony I know!"
 
Clypeus groaned and rubbed his eyes with his hooves. "Alright. What did you tell him?"
 
Day Dreamer shuffled his wings, eyes firmly locked on a rock at his hooves. "All I said was I found a changeling in Las Pegasus. Um. And, uh, that I asked her to… yknow."
 
"No, I [i]don't[/i] know. What [i]exactly[/i] did you say to him?"
 
"I said…" His gaze briefly flicked up to meet Clypeus's before immediately returning to the ground. He started tracing circles in the dirt with the tip of his right hoof. "I said I met a changeling in Las Pegasus, and that I…" He swallowed. "I said I had a plan to find a changeling to replace me so I could be happy."
 
"Anything else?" Clypeus's expression was carved out of marble.
 
"I… I said I planned to meet the changeling later. But don't worry, I lied! I didn't tell him the real plan! I told them that I scheduled a meeting with her outside of Salt Lick City. I said I never told her anything about me. I didn't say I told the changeling my address. So now they think I'll try to meet a changeling somewhere else!"
 
Day Dreamer had recovered enough confidence to risk a smile at Clypeus. "My parents grounded me, but that just means they keep me at my house where you can find me! They think I'll be safe at home, but really I'll be even easier for you to find and replace!"
 
A cold breeze blew by. Tree leaves rustled around them.

Day Dreamer shivered.

Clypeus stared.
 
[hr]

"Aren't you forgetting something?"
 
Looking back, I see Summer's contagious grin and his hoof outstretched holding my favorite scarf. "You always forget stuff."
 
Grabbing it, I take a moment to appreciate its addictively silky texture. I rub the scarf around my hooves and nuzzle it to my cheek. 
 
[spoiler]"I still think that's kinda weird," Summer says.[/spoiler]
 
"C'mon, let's fly!" Scarf snugly swaddled around my neck, I take a running leap and soar into the night. I flap my wings furiously and break through the clouds. Summer Wind passes me with a few flaps of his powerful wings.
 
I look up.
 
Heavenly lights surround us.

[hr]

"Day Dreamer," said Clypeus slowly. "Do you have any idea what you just did?"
 
"Uh… not really?" 
 
"You completely ruined our plan. I don't know if I can replace you anymore."
 
"What?!" Day Dreamer's smile shattered. 
 
"How many times did I tell you, '[i]Don't[/i]. [i]Tell[/i]. [i]Anyone[/i].'?" Clypeus punctuated each word with a jab of his left hoof. "Do you know what 'anyone' means, Dreamer? Did you never learn?"
 
"I…" The colt withered under his guest's glare.
 
Clypeus stood to all four hooves. He trotted a few steps away, looking into the distance. "I really don't know why I trusted a foal like you to understand the risks of your little plan. You clearly can't understand risks at all."
 
"Hey!" Day Dreamer frowned. "At least I kept [i]you[/i] secret!"
 
"You really don't get it, do you?" Clypeus shook his head. "This goes beyond me. Beyond you. If the Guard catches on, we could put any number of changelings at risk." 
 
Clypeus turned around. "You're not only risking the two of us anymore. You're risking my entire hive."

He stepped closer and looked his host in the eye. "I'm sorry, Day Dreamer. I cannot replace you."
 
Moisture welled up in the corners of Day Dreamer's eyes. "After all this time? But, but we're so close! You said just last week that we're almost ready!" He sniffled. "It's not fair!"
 
Undisguised changelings cannot roll their eyes, a fact that was perfectly fine by Clypeus [i]most[/i] of the time. "No, what's 'not fair' is that you broke your promise not to tell anyone. You threw away our only chance at the last minute. You have no one but yourself to blame." 
 
"I thought you were my friend."
 
"Your mistake." Clypeus's glare hardened. "You crossed the line in your little interview earlier when you told that stallion you went looking for changelings. I didn't want to take away our light at the end of the tunnel, but you're not giving me a choice."
 
"What do I do now?" said Day Dreamer, openly crying. "My parents grounded me!"
 
"Tough luck, grub. You should've thought of that before blabbing about us. I knew trusting a pony was a mistake."
 
"Wait! Please! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!"
 
"It's too late. The damage is done. Your parents are suspicious of changelings now. So are the Guards. Hay, I wouldn't be surprised if the Princesses know now. Your little slip-up pushed us beyond the point of no return."
 
Clypeus sighed. "As soon as I replace you, your parents will notice the difference."
 
"No!" Day Dreamer frantically shook his head. "No, they won't! I swear they won't!"
 
"Even if I believed you, I can't take that risk. Noling will risk you anymore."
 
"Please! Please, I'll do anything!"
 
"Goodbye, Day Dreamer. Have a nice life." Green fire erased the changeling and left behind an owl. It hopped onto a low tree branch and spread its wings to fly away.
 
"I'll—" Day Dreamer hesitated for less than a second before blurting, "I'll give you my memories!"
 
The owl stopped with both wings outstretched.
 
"Then nopony will tell the difference," Day Dreamer said.
 
Neither creature moved.
 
The world fell silent.
 
[hr]
 
"Gorgeous, aren't they?" I say, eagerly watching Summer Wind's face for his reaction.
 
"Yeah, you weren't kidding! Maybe next time [spoiler][color=#000000]█████████[/color][/spoiler] can come with us. I'd love to show her."
 
"Huh?" I must have misheard him.
 
"You know, [spoiler][color=#000000]█████████[/color],[/spoiler] my [spoiler]filly[/spoiler]friend? Come on, Dreamer, you met her before. We've been [spoiler]dating[/spoiler] for months. Don't tell me you forgot her name again!"
 
"Yeah, of course I remember her name," I lie. "Look, a shooting star!”
 
A streak of light flashes through the sky and disappears.

I smile and lean closer to Summer. "I can't wait to see the dawn together with you." 
 
"Dreamer, I already told you that I'm [spoiler]leaving[/spoiler] your [spoiler]place before[/spoiler] dawn. Thanks for showing me all this, [spoiler]but[/spoiler] I'm [spoiler]going[/spoiler] home."
 
"We are. We're home together."
 
"Don't worry. I'll make sure [spoiler]to write if[/spoiler] you [spoiler]do, but I[/spoiler] have [spoiler]to go[/spoiler] this [spoiler]time.[/spoiler] Good[spoiler]bye,[/spoiler] Dream[spoiler]er[/spoiler]."

[/size][/b][/i][/pre-line][/center]

[hr]
 
Six agonizing seconds passed before the owl and its wings folded.

In a flash of green light, Clypeus returned. The changeling trotted right up to Day Dreamer's face, uncomfortably close, and then stared directly into his eyes. "Are you [i]sure?[/i]"
 
"Yes!" Dreamer answered too quickly. "I mean it. I'll let you in my head. I'll give you my memories. You said you can do that, right?"
 
"If I do," Clypeus slowly began, "then you can never take it back. If you let me in, I keep your memories so far forever."
 
"I'll do it."
 
"You know what that means, right? No secrets. No privacy. No holding anything back. You have to give me [i]everything[/i]. I would learn every embarrassing thought, feeling, and memory you ever experienced. I could share whichever of them I want with whoever I want."
 
Dreamer's eyes itched as he refused to blink. "I [i]said[/i] I'll do it."
 
"This is your last chance to say no. If you don't want me to take your entire life, then we can go our separate ways. I won't hurt you. No hard feelings."
 
"Just [i]DO IT![/i]" Day Dreamer screamed. He glared at the changeling, refusing to look away.
 
Day Dreamer's eyes watered.

Wind whistled through the trees. 

His vision blurred.
 
Clypeus blinked first. He narrowed his eyes, and then sighed in resignation. "You have no idea how lucky you are that the failure in Canterlot made my hive so desperate."
 
"You'll do it?" Cautious hope crept into Dreamer's voice.
 
Clypeus closed his eyes. In a flash, he became Day Dreamer. "Fine."
 
Overwhelming relief and gratitude flooded through the pony. Clypeus promptly ate them.
 
Giddy warmth bubbled up in both Day Dreamers' hearts, rushing out through their veins, burning away one's clawing hunger and the other's heavy bile, leaving nothing behind but white-hot bliss. Both sighed in pleasure, their muscles involuntarily relaxing.
 
Clypeus burped. "We're not done yet," he said. "Giving me your memories isn't fun. I'll have to put you to sleep first with pod ichor."
 
The colt cocked his head. "With what?"
 
Clypeus took off his Day Dreamer form and, instead of explaining with words, gave a demonstration.
 
After seeing (and, to his dismay, feeling) his guest's explanatory demonstration — one involving several thick sticky globs of a biologically [i]fascinating[/i] bodily fluid produced in specialized internal sacs and secreted from a set of uniquely adapted sweat glands inside of an oddly located cavity in the forelimb — Day Dreamer made a face. "Ew."
 
"Yeah. You'll have to drink that stuff."
 
The changeling gave his host a moment to digest that detail.
 
"And that's only the beginning. Giving me your memories takes hours that feel like days or even weeks. You'll have to relive some of the most painful moments of your life while I watch."
 
Day Dreamer frowned, looking at his hooves. He flipped over a rock, noticing the insect life thriving underneath.
 
"Last chance to back out," said Clypeus. "Will you give me everything in your mind?"
 
"Yes." No hesitation.
 
"Then find a good spot to lay down. You'll want to get comfy."
 
"Alright," the changeling said as he raised a dripping leg, "now open wide and try to stay still…"
 
"Wait!"
 
"What now?"
 
"Just promise me one thing."
 
"What?"
